Project aims to determine whether it is a sound business plan to venture into selling premium coffee, because of the growing global demand for coffee consumption. Datasets are obtained from Kaggle and Macrotrends. Data validation and statistical analysis skills in python programming are demonstrated by performing normality checks, statistical data transformation for non-parametric data, outlier analysis, random sampling, hypothesis and associated test, and probability to answer business research questions like "Is the mean coffee total quality score similar among countries?", "Is the mean coffee price similar among coffee total quality score?", "What is the ideal price to purchase coffee?", and "Is it a good time to enter the business of selling premium coffee?".
